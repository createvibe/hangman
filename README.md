# Hangman
Fun hangman project I wrote for my nephews.

# JavaScript
Written in vanilla JavaScript.  No frameworks.

# Keeps score
The scoring has some fuzzy logic that deducts points for bad letter guesses, time elapsed, and game over.
The scoring awards points for handicaps not used and time left on the clock after winning.

# Handicap
Includes a handicap that accumulates as you score points and move up in levels.  
The handicap will automatically cause one strike against you.  
A countdown shows up to show you when the next handicap will kick in.

# Skip Words
Allows you to skip the word if you can't figure it out.

# Create your own game
Allows you to create your own word and hint, so you can play your own games with your friends.

# APIs provide hints for words
Hooked up to different APIs to fetch information about the word and provide hints as time goes by.  
Each hint displayed lowers your score at the end of the level.
